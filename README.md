This is a web app that allows you to view your spotify history, top artists, albums, and tracks.

Things I want to do:

MAKE API URLS ENV VARS IN FRONTEND

1. Deploy on something and automate history collection
2. Improve UI (maybe include images in database depending on storage limits)
3. Include more interesting data analysis (maybe start collecting genre, popularity information)
4. Some ML implementation
   a. Mood analysis
   b. New music/media recommendations
